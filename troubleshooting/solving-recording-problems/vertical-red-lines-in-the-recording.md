# Vertical red lines in the recording

## Causes

This is a visual indication that your recording has [clipping](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/audacity_waveform.html#clip). See [crackles-pops-and-distortion-in-the-recording.md](crackles-pops-and-distortion-in-the-recording.md "mention") for more information.

## Fixes

The vertical red lines show where the clipping has occurred; these clipping indicators can be turned on and off _(Audacity default setting is "off")_ by selecting **View ->** **Show Clipping in Waveform**.
