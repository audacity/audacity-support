# Recording isn't working into initial track made on audacity startup

## Causes

When starting audacity and trying to record to a track it is setup to record in one type of recording channel, so if you do not have a track in the preset format it will make one for you and (potentially) not record in your desired format. 

## Fixes

To fix this, you have to go into audio-setup>recording-channels to select the desired channel type to record to. If you don't have a channel made in the desired channel type (mono/stereo) then it will autamatically create one for you.
