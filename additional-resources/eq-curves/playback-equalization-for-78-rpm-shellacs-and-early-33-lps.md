# Playback equalization for 78 rpm shellacs and early 33⅓ LPs

The audio on almost every phonograph record is not the same as that originally performed. For technical reasons the signal's frequencies need to be modified when cutting the disc. Playback equalization (EQ or de-emphasis) is necessary to restore the signal's original frequencies. Only thus can music lovers enjoy the original sound of the music performed long ago from their rare discs.

## Usage

The most relevant EQ curves are presented as [Table 1](playback-equalization-for-78-rpm-shellacs-and-early-33-lps.md#table-1-playback-equalization-curves):

* You can download some of them from the [EQ Curves Library](broken-reference) section of this page, convert them to a TXT file with EQ XML to TXT Converter and import them into Audacity using or
* You can generate any curve yourself with the [78 rpm EQ Curve Generator](broken-reference) plugin
* You can set the sliders of any digital or analog graphic equalizer manually
* You can determine appropriate settings for any adjustable analog pre-amplifier.

Which EQ curve will be needed for a specific record label is answered:

* for 78 rpm shellacs in [Table 2](playback-equalization-for-78-rpm-shellacs-and-early-33-lps.md#table-2-78-rpm-shellac-labels-and-their-eq)
* for early LPs in [Table 3](playback-equalization-for-78-rpm-shellacs-and-early-33-lps.md#table-3-early-33-lp-labels-and-their-eq)

### Equalization (EQ) Curves explained

When phonograph records are made, the sound being recorded is deliberately distorted by reducing the volume of the low frequencies and increasing the volume of the high frequencies. This process, known as 'pre-emphasis', allows the low frequencies to be accommodated in the limitations of the record groove and reduces the effect of high frequency surface noise. If pre-emphasis was not carried out, the bass notes in the music would create a groove in the record that oscillated so wildly that the stylus could jump out of it on playback, and the treble notes would be drowned out by the surface noise of the stylus in the groove.

On playback, the pre-emphasis must be reversed in order to restore the original sound. This is known as 'de-emphasis' or equalization (EQ).

Modern vinyl records use a method of pre-emphasis and de-emphasis adopted by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the 1950's, and the EQ curve used is known as the RIAA curve. However, before the RIAA curve was adopted, each record label used its own EQ curve for recording and, for these records (78rpm and early vinyl), the correct EQ curve must be used for playback.

Each EQ curve is a combination of two filter characteristics; a bass boost curve, defined by a 'Bass Turnover' (or 3dB) frequency, and a treble cut curve, defined by a '10 kHz Gain Roll-off' parameter, i.e. a defined level of treble cut at 10 kHz.

As an example, Figure 1 below shows the characteristic of the bass boost curve defined by a 500Hz Bass Turnover, and Figure 2 shows the characteristic of the treble cut curve defined by a 10 kHz Gain Roll-off of -13.7dB. These two curves, when combined, give the characteristic shown in Figure 3.\

The EQ curve may also include a Low Frequency Shelving filter, (although it is absent from the definition of most 78 rpm EQ curves). This addition reduces the effect of the bass boost at very low frequencies (typically 50 or 100 Hz) in order to attenuate low-frequency noise such as turntable rumble. Figure 4 shows the effect of a 50 Hz LF shelving filter being added to the curve in Figure 3. This is in fact the RIAA standard EQ curve.

Acoustically recorded (pre-electric) 78 rpm records have a completely different characteristic because they were cut with a different type of cutter (For more details see: Acoustic recordings). In some early EQ curves of electrically recorded shellacs, while there is a bass boost curve, there is no treble cut necessary – i.e. the 10 kHz gain roll-off is zero.

Note that in the combined EQ curve, the gains at the Bass Turnover frequency and at 10 kHz may be different from those specified by the parameters. This is not an error, but is due to fact that the gains of the bass boost and treble cut curves are simply added together.

Because 78 rpm EQ curves were non-standard and, in many cases, accurate records were not kept to show what EQ curves were used when recording 78s, there is a degree of uncertainty about what is the correct playback EQ for many record labels. The tables below have been obtained from websites which, in their turn, have compiled data from a number of sources and should prove reasonably accurate. However, the ear of the listener is the final arbiter - if it doesn't sound right, it isn't right!

According to NAB standards, the nominal speed of a 78 rpm record is precisely 78.26 rpm +/- 0.3% (for North America and other countries with an utility frequency of 60 Hz). According to British Standards Institution it is 77.92 rpm +/- 0.5% (for Britain, Europe and other countries with a mains frequency of 50 Hz).

## EQ Curves

Pre-equalization of most records – especially of shellacs – was always determined by the cutter head used and often by internal regulations of the record company. Both left quite some room for the recording engineer to make changes to improve the sound. Also if Graumann uses 250 Hz in playback of an EMI disc and Copeland votes for 300 Hz this is not a contradiction. Both mean the same EQ curve but have different opinions on what sounds best. This should encourage you to try both versions and take the one which sounds right to your ears.

Please do not worry about fractions of a dB! Still in the 1960s an accuracy of a curve of +/- 2 dB was considered to be standard. In the 1950s +/- 3 dB were a very fine result and nobody will ever know if recording engineers in the 1940s or 1930s applied their curves correctly (or if they applied them at all!) So the spread in pre-equalization during recording will outnumber any bias in playback equalization by far.

### Table of EQ Curves

The most relevant EQ curves are presented in Table 1. All curves are described from the point of view of a playback or de-emphasis curve, where bass / low frequencies must be amplified / boosted and where treble / high frequencies must be attenuated / cut in order to achieve the original sound that had been recorded. The corresponding pre-emphasis curve used for cutting the master disk is inverse.

When comparing with lists provided by the manufacturers of equalizer pre-amps it should be considered that those may be misleading, as they might not quote the correct parameters of the curve but rather the next-best possible settings of these devices. For example the Conductart OWL 1 Sound Restoration Module – a renowned pre-amp of the 1980s – offered settings of flat/ 250/ 375/ 500/ 750/ 1000/ RIAA for turnover and flat/ 5/ 8.5/ 12/ 14/ 16/ RIAA for roll-off. Thus for the widely used standard “AES 400N-12” settings of 375 Hz and -12 dB were listed; for the “Bartok 629C-16” curve it was 750 Hz and -16 dB and for “LONDON LP 500C-10.5” it was 500 Hz and -8.5 dB. These recommendations were quoted or copied by other authors and three “new characteristics” had come to existence.

Table 1 gives the three parameters to characterize any EQ curve: the turnover frequency f1 for bass shelf, f2 for bass boost and f3 for treble cut (or alternatively the three corresponding time constants τ1, τ2 and τ3). These are the necessary conditions to compute and plot any EQ curve, determine the correct settings of a digital equalizer or to solder an electronic filter circuit.

The gain at two typical frequencies will give you a rough impression of what the curve does to the audio from the record. The frequencies are:

* 50 Hz, where usually the bass shelf becomes effective
* 10 kHz, because the treble curve is often indicated by roll-off at 10,000 Hz

The very descriptive “code” is a good tool to avoid misunderstanding when EQ curves come under various alias names (what they do too often).

* The first 3-digit number indicates the turnover frequency of bass boost (f2)
* The letter in the middle is\
  N … (“None”) if no bass shelving is applied, or\
  R … 20 dB (named R after RCA or RIAA)\
  B … 18 dB\
  A … 16 dB\
  C … 14 dB (named C after Columbia LP curve)\
  X … 12 dB
* The last number shows the reduction or roll-off of treble at 10 kHz and is always preceded by a minus sign. Please mind that this is only a code and that the exact value – after normalization to 0 dB at 1000 Hz – might be different.

This code can be used to find the correct settings of most equalizer pre-amps.

(Example: “RIAA 500R-13.7” means for the RIAA curve that bass must be boosted below 500 Hz, but no more than + 20 dB and that treble must be cut at 10,000 Hz to – 13.7 dB)

The geographic region and the time period are added to allow a qualified guess for the required EQ should a record label not be listed. In general, American recording curves were more deliberate in cutting bass and boosting treble. The British and Europeans tended to apply only the necessary minimum of bass attenuation and often no treble boost at all, that means they had a “flat” treble curve. Early pre-emphasis curves were simply built and rather soft. In the late years (after 1945) curves became highly sophisticated, with the third turnover frequency f1 added to manage the bass shelving and also with gain ranging from -20 dB to + 20dB.

Thus a setting of 13.7 dB is correct!

### Individual fine tuning

In some cases it will be not enough to apply the correct EQ to get the desired result. According to the condition of the record and to personal listening preferences you might consider one of the following methods:

* The 250-or-300-Hz dilemma: To use “European250” or “Blumlein300” EQ seems to be not a question of right or wrong but of personal listening preferences. In general, Continental European authors prefer 250 Hz (derived from the original Western Electric recommendation) for Decca (Brit. and Europ.), Brunswick, Cetra, Columbia (Brit.), EMI-HMV and Parlophone. Englishman Copeland favors 300 Hz (derived from the recording characteristic of the Blumlein cutter) for British EMI, His Master’s Voice and Columbia and also for Odeon. Copeland puts it like this: “\[…] but when I’m not sure I use 300 Hz.” \[Copeland, Manual, p 129]. Being derived from the previous 250-or-300-Hz curve the same applies to “DECCA78” which was used from 1944 for shellacs with the ffrr system. So you should also feel free to decide the 250-or-300-Hz question according to your own listening preference: 300 Hz will give an extra amplification of bass in play back (ca 1.5 dB at 50 Hz).
* To remove low frequency noise Robinson (MidiMagic) recommends a low cut filter at 100 Hz with just 6 dB/octave. (Especially for many acoustic recordings which have only noise below 150 Hz or for the “long-playing” shellacs of RCA Victor of 1931/32). This filter will do exactly the same as the “C”-type bass shelf of Columbia LP curve.
* Vadlyd uses a variable low cut filter for American Victor, early British Decca, EMI, His Master’s Voice and Columbia at frequencies between 40 and 70 Hz. This is very similar to the recommendation of Phonomuseum.org. In Audacity you can experiment with different settings for “Frequency” and “Roll-off” in Effect -> High Pass Filter (a different word for Low Cut Filter) and listen to the result with “Preview”.
* All bass shelf settings on analog equalizers (R-B-A-C-X) can also be used to remove low frequency noise (especially from acoustics and early shellacs). This is why the extra positions X and A were provided \[MidiMagic]
* A known trick of recording engineers was to increase bass t/o frequency on very long recordings. Thus bass attenuation was increased and bass amplitude and necessary groove width were reduced. So the given duration of the audio could be squeezed into the given space on the disc. If a disc is filled with grooves as can be a higher bass turnover frequency can be necessary to restore the original sound. Example: Colosseum \[ES]
* To improve the weak bass on some 45s (especially on EPs – Extended Play) Esoteric Sound uses a higher turnover frequency for bass in replay than in pre-equalization. For example 700 Hz instead of the “correct” 500 Hz. This will give a smooth, extra bass amplification of roughly 4 dB at 50 Hz.
* To reduce surface noise of early American Columbia, Victor and RCA-Victor iasa recommends an additional high cut (= low pass) filter set to 5500 or 5200 Hz with 6 dB/octave. This will reduce treble by 3 dB at around 5000 Hz and by 9 dB at 10000 Hz – and hopefully most of the noise.

#### Remarks for Analog Purists

* Hiss and high frequency scratch due to old worn records:\
  When digitizing such recordings Audacity’s will do a good job to improve the sound once and for all. Those who prefer entirely analog replay with an adjustable pre-amplifier will have the opportunity to improve the sound every time they replay. They can cut / attenuate the frequency range most affected by the noise. A higher value for roll-off at 10 kHz than the “correct” EQ will usually give a better result than a simple treble filter – but: at the expense of the high frequencies of the audio itself.
* Dull, lifeless sound:\
  If you improve poor bass on discs of any speed by choosing a higher bass turnover frequency than the “correct” EQ, there will be the welcome side effect of moderately amplifying midrange frequencies. This will bring life to the core octaves of a piece of music by improving instrument and vocal characteristics.

## Acoustic recordings and Broadcast Transcription Discs

Acoustic recordings (before 1926) are beyond the scope of this page. In these pioneer years speeds varied from 70 to 90 rpm, groove modulation could be lateral, vertical or diagonal and some records were even cut outward with the audio starting at the center. A special turntable and a range of styli / needles are needed to replay.

All acoustics were recorded without any pre-equalization, simply because a modification of the audio was impossible before electric microphones and amplifiers came into use. Nonetheless there are conflicting opinions as to the result:

According to various authors the acoustical recording process had an "inherent mechanical equalization", which results – within the limited frequency range of approx. 150 to 4000 Hz – in a constant velocity characteristic one would only expect from a magnetic cutter. With a magnetic cartridge this would command to be replayed “flat”. Please note that the acoustical recording characteristic is not equalized at all.

According to Robinson an acoustical recording must have a constant-amplitude characteristic which will be correctly reproduced by playing back with a gramophone needle or a piezoelectric crystal pickup. A magnetic cartridge will – by its constant velocity characteristic – double the amplitude whenever the frequency doubles. To compensate for the magnetic pickup MidiMagic recommends an “800N-16” EQ curve, which comes close to the theoretical characteristic of a constant velocity device. Some more information is here on [record labels](http://audacity.xmission.eu/acoustics\_2016\_05\_19.pdf) and on [technical background](http://audacity.xmission.eu/Acoustic\_Electric.pdf). Please note that the acoustical recording characteristic is not equalized at all.

Kolkowski’s results of a [reenactment](http://journal.sciencemuseum.ac.uk/browse/issue-03/the-art-and-science-of-acoustic-recording/) of an acoustic recording session show that bass needs heavy equalization if the losses in the recording horn (here below 400 Hz) shall be compensated for. Parametric equalization may be used at resonant frequencies. Treble should be amplified (!) to compensate for the high-frequency roll-off of the recorder. Due to the individual properties (defects) of recording horns and recorders there will be no “general characteristic” of acoustics and therefore no general EQ.

Broadcast Transcription Discs are not in the focus of this page either. Those were recordable lacquer discs, mostly 16 inch in diameter, played at 33⅓ or 78 rpm. They were professionally used by radio broadcasters. Some more information is in [this PDF](http://audacity.xmission.eu/transcr\_2016\_05\_19.pdf).

In America many of these discs were recorded under the standard of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) of 1942. The very same recording curve had been used by NBC under the name “Orthacoustic” since mid 1930s. This “NAB Transcription (1942)” playback EQ setting can be downloaded here.

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used a rather exotic curve as a house standard. The version in use after 1949 has been reconstructed from Longford-Smith’s publication of 1952 as an Audacity EQ setting “BBC Transcription (1949)” and can be downloaded here.

### 78 rpm shellac labels and their EQ

This page is about electrical recordings since 1925 on 78 rpm discs made of shellac! The invention of the Electrical Recording System by Bell Laboratories / Western Electric which was licensed to industry leaders Columbia Records and Victor set some de-facto standards: speed is always 78 rpm, cut is always lateral (same as later mono LPs) and the groove type is always Normal Groove (also named coarse groove). Therefore shellacs are sometimes referred to as N78 (which stands for normal groove discs, played at 78 rpm).

A turntable capable of 78 rpm will be useful. You will need a MONO stylus with 2.5 mil (64 μm), for early electricals possibly one with 3 mil (76 μm) and this Audacity Wiki!

It is assumed that you replay your discs “flat” (without any analog de-equalization) and apply the necessary EQ after digitizing with Audacity . If it is necessary to play the record through a system that applies modern RIAA equalization, select the "RIAA" curve in Audacity's Filter Curve EQ effect and use the Invert button to invert and thus remove the incorrect RIAA equalization before applying the appropriate equalization to the recording.

In case sources did not agree on one EQ curve, their different opinions are listed and you will have to trust your ears.

* \[Bc] ... Due to changes in the setup of the Blumlein cutter the characteristic of the recordings could vary between 180 Hz-FLAT and 500 Hz-FLAT, resulting in +/- 4 dB at 50 Hz. Copeland suggests 300 Hz as an average value.
* \[CAP]... used its own “Capitol curve” 400N-12.7. Play back with “AES” 400N-12.3!
* \[MGM] ... used a special “MGM curve” 500N-12. Play back with “RCA Old Orthophonic” 500N-13.7!
* \[R-D] ... Roll-off is frequently listed as between 10 and 12 dB. But this “flattening off” to ca 10 dB at 10 kHz was an intentional high cut which must not be compensated for in playback. Thus a setting of 13.7 dB is correct!
* \[R-C] ... RCA recommends replaying with “Old Ortho.”. High frequencies were cut off more deliberately at 8,500 Hz (with no effect on playback EQ!) than in later years. \[cf. Moyer]
* \[R-B] ... From c. 1931 to 1938 high frequencies were even cut off at 5,500 Hz! The bass curve is “subject to some question, however,” since it was extensively modified by electronic filters and mechanical damping. But RCA found 500 Hz to be the best average characteristic and used this in re-recording pre-1938 masters. So in principle: “Old Ortho.” for playback again! \[cf. Moyer]
* \[TCH] ... Technichord used its own “Technichord curve” 800N-12. Play back with “RCA 45” 800N-13.7!
* \[W.E.] ... Very early Columbia and Victor recordings (1926) used a bass turnover frequency of 250 or 300 Hz but their treble is described as “flat”. The perceived treble amplification was possibly only the result of resonant peaks of the early Western Electric condenser microphones used in recording. Background information is given in [this PDF](http://audacity.xmission.eu/Early\_Western\_Electric\_Characteristic.pdf). An experimental replay EQ curve for this microphone / pre-emphasis combination can be downloaded ‎here.

### Early 33⅓ LP labels and their EQ

After the launch of the “long-playing record 33⅓ rpm” by Columbia in 1948 (which used vinyl discs and a narrower groove width – microgroove records or M33) record producers experimented a lot to fully exploit the potential of the new medium. Bass shelving came into use to limit the necessary bass boost in playback and – as a consequence of the extended frequency range – necessary gain reached values as high as +/- 20 dB. So recording characteristics varied considerably!

The “poor sound quality” of some early LPs is nowadays considered to be mostly a result of the wrong EQ in playback.

Standardization was reached with the “New Orthophonic” curve of RCA which was to become the world standard by the name of RIAA. In America most labels switched to RIAA around 1955 – Europe followed by 1962.

{% hint style="info" %}
How to identify RIAA recordings:

* “ORTHOphonic” or “New Orthophonic” (after August 1952), “NARTB” or “New NARTB” (after June 1953) or “New AES” (after 1954) indicate RIAA equalization.
* The following labels should have used only RIAA all the time: Argo, Bethlehem, Classic Editions, Chess, Clef, Composer Recordings, McIntosh, Montilla, New Jazz, Norgram, Prestige, Romany, Roulette, Savoy, Vocalion and Walden \[High Fidelity Magazine, MidiMagic].
* A “HIFi+” sticker on American Columbias or the catalogue number written in an inverted triangle on German records (like Deutsche Grammophon) is a symbol for RIAA.
* Later recordings on the labels listed below should all be RIAA.

<summary>Remarks</summary>

* \[1]... This EQ can be traced back to Langford-Smith (1952), who vaguely describes a “London LP curve (Jan. 1951)”. Powell reads this as 300Hz (wrong!) and -14 dB (correct!). Copeland judges evidence “to be very defective.” No evidence of usage.
* \[CAP]... used its own “Capitol curve” 400N-12.7. Play back with “AES” 400N-12.3!
* \[MGM] ... used a special “MGM curve” 500N-12. Play back with “RCA Old Orthophonic” 500N-12.3!
* \[R-D] ... Roll-off is frequently listed as between 10 and 12 dB. But this “flattening off” to ca 10 dB at 10 kHz was an intentional high cut which must not be compensated for in playback. Thus a setting of 13.7 dB is correct!
* \[R-C] ... RCA recommends replaying with “Old Ortho.”. High frequencies were cut off more deliberately at 8,500 Hz (with no effect on playback EQ!) than in later years. \[cf. Moyer]
* \[R-B] ... From c. 1931 to 1938 high frequencies were even cut off at 5,500 Hz! The bass curve is “subject to some question, however,” since it was extensively modified by electronic filters and mechanical damping. But RCA found 500 Hz to be the best average characteristic and used this in re-recording pre-1938 masters. So in principle: “Old Ortho.” for playback again! \[cf. Moyer]
