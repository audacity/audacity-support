To use it,

1. Select the target EQ effect. Curves to be imported can be either for [Filter Curve EQ](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/filter\_curve\_eq.html) effect or [Graphic EQ](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/graphic\_eq.html) effect but _not_ both.
2. Select your source XML file.
3. (optional) select what should happen if the file exists already
4. Click OK.&#x20;

The TXT file now is in the same location as the source XML file.

You now can import the TXT file via Filter Curve EQ or Graphic EQ -> **Presets and settings -> Import...**
