# Keyboard Shortcuts

&#x20;The default **Standard** set of shortcuts is a reduced set, compared to earlier versions of Audacity, to simplify the set of shortcuts somewhat and to provide greater flexibility for users who wish to create their own shortcuts. There is also an extended **Full** set of keyboard shortcuts that can be selected from the Defaults button on the Keyboard Preferences dialog. This **Full** set is the set that was available in Audacity 2.1.3 and earlier. You can use Keyboard Preferences to change or remove existing shortcuts or to assign a shortcut to commands that lack a default shortcut.

* Standard shortcuts are shown like so: `Ctrl + A`.
* Shortcuts that are only in the **Full** set are shown like so: `Ctrl + #`   _Extra_.
* Shortcuts that have not been assigned, that you can assign using keyboard preferences, are shown like so _(unassigned)_.

Some less commonly used commands are not in the default menus but they can be accessed by menu by enabling **Show extra menus** in Interface Preferences

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You can change all shortcuts via Preferences > Keyboard. This includes adding new shortcuts, or removing shortcuts existing by default.
{% endhint %}



**Other Tips and hints:**

* **Mac users:** Ctrl = ⌘ and Alt = Option. So, for example, Ctrl + Alt + K = ⌘ + Option + K.
* See Audacity Selection for examples of changing track focus and selection.
* PAGE UP scrolls the project rightwards and PAGE DOWN scrolls the project leftwards, equivalent to a single click in the white area either side of the horizontal scrollbar. These shortcuts cannot be configured in Keyboard Preferences.
* There are a number of key combinations that can be used in combination with mouse clicks. These cannot be configured. They are listed on Mouse Preferences

| Play/Stop                | Space       | Starts and stops playback or stops a recording (stopping does not change the restart position). Therefore using any play or record command after stopping with "Play/Stop" will start playback or recording from the same Timeline position it last started from. You can also assign separate shortcuts for [Play](broken-reference) and [Stop](broken-reference). |
| Play/Stop and Set Cursor | X           | Starts playback like "Play/Stop", but stopping playback sets the restart position to the stop point. When stopped, this command is the same as "Play/Stop". When playing, this command stops playback and moves the cursor (or the start of the selection) to the position where playback stopped.                                                                  |

| Change Pitch...           | _(unassigned)_ | Change the pitch of a selection without changing its tempo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Change Speed...           | _(unassigned)_ | Change the speed of a selection, also changing its pitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Change Tempo...           | _(unassigned)_ | Change the tempo and length (duration) of a selection without changing its pitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Click Removal...          | _(unassigned)_ | Click Removal is designed to remove clicks on audio tracks and is especially suited to declicking recordings made from vinyl records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Compressor...             | _(unassigned)_ | Compresses the _**dynamic range**_ by two alternative methods. The default "_**RMS**_" method makes the louder parts softer, but leaves the quieter audio alone. The alternative "peaks" method makes the entire audio louder, but amplifies the louder parts less than the quieter parts. Make-up _**gain**_ can be applied to either method, making the result as loud as possible without _**clipping**_, but not changing the dynamic range further.                  |
| Distortion...             | _(unassigned)_ | Use the Distortion effect to make the audio sound distorted. By distorting the waveform the frequency content is changed, which will often make the sound "crunchy" or "abrasive". Technically this effect is a [waveshaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveshaper). The result of waveshaping is equivalent to applying non-linear amplification to the audio waveform. Preset shaping functions are provided, each of which produces a different type of distortion. |
| Echo...                   | _(unassigned)_ | Repeats the selected audio again and again, normally softer each time and normally not blended into the original sound until some time after it starts. The delay time between each repeat is fixed, with no pause in between each repeat. For a more configurable echo effect with a variable delay time and pitch-changed echoes, see Delay.                                                                                                                            |
| Fade In                   | _(unassigned)_ | Applies a _**linear**_ fade-in to the selected audio - the rapidity of the fade-in depends entirely on the length of the selection it is applied to. For a more customizable _**logarithmic**_ fade, use the Envelope Tool on the Tools Toolbar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Fade Out                  | _(unassigned)_ | <p>Applies a <em><strong>linear</strong></em> fade-out to the selected audio - the rapidity of the fade-out depends entirely on the length of the selection it is applied to. For a more customizable <em><strong>logarithmic</strong></em> fade, use the Envelope Tool on the Tools Toolbar.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Filter Curve...           | _(unassigned)_ | Adjusts the volume levels of particular frequencies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Graphic EQ...             | _(unassigned)_ | Adjusts the volume levels of particular frequencies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Invert                    | _(unassigned)_ | This effect flips the audio samples upside-down. This normally does not affect the sound of the audio at all. It is occasionally useful for vocal removal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Loudness Normalization... | _(unassigned)_ | Changes the perceived loudness of the audio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Noise Reduction...        | _(unassigned)_ | This effect is ideal for reducing constant background noise such as fans, tape noise, or hums. It will not work very well for removing talking or music in the background. More details here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Normalize...              | _(unassigned)_ | Use the Normalize effect to set the maximum amplitude of a track, equalize the amplitudes of the left and right channels of a stereo track and optionally remove any DC offset from the track                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Paulstretch...            | _(unassigned)_ | Use Paulstretch only for an extreme time-stretch or "stasis" effect, This may be useful for synthesizer pad sounds, identifying performance glitches or just creating interesting aural textures. Use Change Tempo or Sliding Time Scale rather than Paulstretch for tasks like slowing down a song to a "practice" tempo.                                                                                                                                                |
| Phaser...                 | _(unassigned)_ | The name "Phaser" comes from "Phase Shifter", because it works by combining phase-shifted signals with the original signal. The movement of the phase-shifted signals is controlled using a Low _**Frequency**_ Oscillator (LFO).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Repair                    | _(unassigned)_ | Fix one particular short click, pop or other glitch no more than 128 samples long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Repeat...                 | _(unassigned)_ | Repeats the selection the specified number of times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Reverb...                 | _(unassigned)_ | A configurable stereo reverberation effect with built-in and user-added presets. It can be used to add ambience (an impression of the space in which a sound occurs) to a mono sound. Also use it to increase reverberation in stereo audio that sounds too "dry" or "close".                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Reverse                   | _(unassigned)_ | Reverses the selected audio; after the effect the end of the audio will be heard first and the beginning last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Sliding Stretch...        | _(unassigned)_ | This effect allows you to make a continuous change to the tempo and/or pitch of a selection by choosing initial and/or final change values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Adjustable Fade...               | _(unassigned)_ | enables you to control the shape of the fade (non-linear fading) to be applied by adjusting various parameters; allows partial _(that is not from or to zero)_ fades up or down.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Clip Fix...                      | _(unassigned)_ | Clip Fix attempts to reconstruct clipped regions by interpolating the lost signal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Crossfade Clips                  | _(unassigned)_ | Use Crossfade Clips to apply a simple crossfade to a selected pair of clips in a single audio track.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Crossfade Tracks...              | _(unassigned)_ | Use Crossfade Tracks to make a smooth transition between two overlapping tracks one above the other. Place the track to be faded out above the track to be faded in then select the overlapping region in both tracks and apply the effect.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Delay...                         | _(unassigned)_ | A configurable delay effect with variable delay time and pitch shifting of the delays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| High-Pass Filter...              | _(unassigned)_ | Passes frequencies above its cutoff frequency and attenuates frequencies below its cutoff frequency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Limiter...                       | _(unassigned)_ | Limiter passes signals below a specified input level unaffected or gently reduced, while preventing the peaks of stronger signals from exceeding this threshold. Mastering engineers often use this type of dynamic range compression combined with make-up gain to increase the perceived loudness of an audio recording during the audio mastering process.                                  |
| Low-Pass Filter...               | _(unassigned)_ | Passes frequencies below its cutoff frequency and attenuates frequencies above its cutoff frequency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Notch Filter...                  | _(unassigned)_ | Greatly attenuate ("notch out"), a narrow frequency band. This is a good way to remove mains hum or a whistle confined to a specific frequency with minimal damage to the remainder of the audio.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Spectral edit multi tool         | _(unassigned)_ | When the selected track is in spectrogram or spectrogram log(f) view, applies a _**notch filter**_, _**high pass filter**_ or _**low pass filter**_ according to the spectral selection made. This effect can also be used to change the audio quality as an alternative to using Equalization.                                                                                                |
| Spectral edit parametric EQ...   | _(unassigned)_ | When the selected track is in spectrogram or spectrogram log(f) view and the spectral selection has a center frequency and an upper and lower boundary, performs the specified _**band cut**_ or _**band boost**_. This can be used as an alternative to Equalization or may also be useful to repair damaged audio by reducing frequency spikes or boosting other frequencies to mask spikes. |
| Spectral edit shelves...         | _(unassigned)_ | When the selected track is in spectrogram or spectrogram log(f) view, applies either a low- or high-frequency shelving filter or both filters, according to the spectral selection made. This can be used as an alternative to Equalization or may also be useful to repair damaged audio by reducing frequency spikes or boosting other frequencies to mask spikes.                           |
| Studio Fade Out                  | _(unassigned)_ | Applies a more musical fade out to the selected audio, giving a more pleasing sounding result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tremolo...                       | _(unassigned)_ | Modulates the volume of the selection at the depth and rate selected in the dialog. The same as the tremolo effect familiar to guitar and keyboard players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Vocal Reduction and Isolation... | _(unassigned)_ | Attempts to remove or isolate center-panned audio from a stereo track. Most "Remove" options in this effect preserve the stereo image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Vocoder...                       | _(unassigned)_ | Synthesizes audio (usually a voice) in the left channel of a stereo track with a _carrier wave_ (typically white noise) in the right channel to produce a modified version of the left channel. Vocoding a normal voice with white noise will produce a robot-like voice for special effects.                                                                                                  |

| Plugin Manager | _(unassigned)_         | Selecting this option from the Effect Menu (or the Generate Menu or Analyze Menu) takes you to a dialog where you can enable or disable particular Effects, Generators and Analyzers in Audacity. Even if you do not add any third-party plugins, you can use this to make the Effect menu shorter or longer as required. For details see Add / Remove Effects, Generators and Analyzers. |
| Contrast...              | Ctrl+Shift+T   _Extra_ | Analyzes a single mono or stereo speech track to determine the average _**RMS**_ _difference in volume_ (contrast) between foreground speech and background music, audience noise or similar. The purpose is to determine if the speech will be intelligible to the hard of hearing.                                                                                                       |
| Plot Spectrum...         | _(unassigned)_         | Takes the selected audio (which is a set of sound pressure values at points in time) and converts it to a graph of frequencies against _**amplitudes**_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Find Clipping...         | _(unassigned)_         | Displays runs of _**clipped**_ samples in a Label Track, as a screen-reader accessible alternative to View > Show Clipping. A run must include at least one clipped sample, but may include unclipped samples too.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Beat Finder...  | _(unassigned)_ | Attempts to place labels at beats which are much louder than the surrounding audio. It's a fairly rough and ready tool, and will not necessarily work well on a typical modern pop music track with compressed _**dynamic range**_. If you do not get enough beats detected, try reducing the "Threshold Percentage" setting. |
| Label Sounds... | _(unassigned)_ | Label Sounds is a tool which can useful to label the different songs or sections (or silences) in a long recording.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Set Track Audio...    | _(unassigned)_ | Sets properties for a track or channel (or both). Can set pan, gain, mute and solo.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Set Track Visuals...  | _(unassigned)_ | Sets visual properties for a track or channel (or both). SpectralPrefs=1 sets the track to use general preferences, SpectralPrefs=1 per track prefs. When using general preferences, SetPreferences can be used to change a preference and so affect display of the track. |
| Get Preference...     | _(unassigned)_ | Gets a single preference setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Set Preference...     | _(unassigned)_ | Sets a single preference setting. Some settings such as them changes require a reload (use Reload=1), but this takes time and slows down a script.                                                                                                                         |
| Set Clip...           | _(unassigned)_ | Modify a clip by stating the track or channel a time within it. Color and start position can be set. Try to avoid overlapping clips, as Audacity will allow it, but does not like them.                                                                                    |
| Set Envelope...       | _(unassigned)_ | Modify an envelope by specifying a track or channel and a time within it. You cannot yet delete individual envelope points, but can delete the whole envelope using Delete=1.                                                                                              |
| Set Label...          | _(unassigned)_ | Modifies an existing label. You must give it the label number.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Set Project...        | _(unassigned)_ | Sets the project window to a particular location and size. Can also change the caption - but that is cosmetic and may be overwritten again later by Audacity.                                                                                                              |

| Select...                    | _(unassigned)_ | Selects audio. Start and End are time. First and Last are track numbers. High and Low are for spectral selection. FromEnd allows selection from the end, which is handy to fade in and fade out a track. The Mode parameter allows complex selections, e.g adding or removing tracks from the current selection.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Set Track...                 | _(unassigned)_ | Sets properties for a track or channel (or both). Setting one channel of a stereo track can lead to interesting results. That's most used when setting relative sizing of the two channels. SpectralPrefs=1 sets the track to use general preferences, SpectralPrefs=1 per track prefs. When using general preferences, SetPreferences can be used to change a preference and so affect display of the track. Name is used to set the name. It is not used in choosing the track. |
| Get Info...                  | _(unassigned)_ | Gets information in a list in one of three formats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Message...                   | _(unassigned)_ | Used in testing. Sends the Text string back to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Help...                      | _(unassigned)_ | This is an extract from GetInfo Commands, with just one command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Import...                    | _(unassigned)_ | Imports from a file. The automation command uses a text box to get the file name rather than a normal file-open dialog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Export...                    | _(unassigned)_ | Exports to a named file. This version of export has the full set of export options. However, a current limitation is that the detailed option settings are always stored to and taken from saved preferences. The net effect is that for a given format, the most recently used options for that format will be used.                                                                                                                                                             |

| Save Project...              | _(unassigned)_ | Saves a project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Move Mouse...                | _(unassigned)_ | Experimental command (called Drag in scripting) that moves the mouse. An Id can be used to move the mouse into a button to get the hover effect. Window names can be used instead. If To is specified, the command does a drag, otherwise just a hover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Compare Audio...             | _(unassigned)_ | Compares selected range on two tracks. Reports on the differences and similarities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Screenshot (short format)... | _(unassigned)_ | A version of Tools -> Screenshot with a more minimal GUI. One of the most useful options is All\_Tracks. The \_Plus suffix includes the timeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
