## Installing with a package from a repository

Your Linux distribution (for example Ubuntu, Fedora or Debian) may have an Audacity package as part of the repository. Generally, the version from a distribution's repository is _older_ than the latest AppImage but it may be better integrated into your distribution.

Access this version from the Software Center, App Store or similar software on your computer or try the following commands:&#x20;

* Ubuntu, Debian, Pop\_OS!, Linux Mint: `sudo apt install audacity`
* RHEL, Fedora: `sudo yum install audacity`
* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -Syu audacity`

{% hint style="info" %}
Repository packages are maintained by the community, not by the Audacity Team.
{% endhint %}

## Installing with a Flatpak or Snap

Community-maintained Flatpaks and Snaps are available from [Flathub ](https://flathub.org/apps/org.audacityteam.Audacity)and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/audacity).&#x20;
