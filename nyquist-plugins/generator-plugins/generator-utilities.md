Nyquist Generate Prompt makes it easy for Nyquist developers to test their code for "Generate" plugins in one step, unlike the Nyquist Prompt built into Audacity under the Effect menu, which requires several steps including pre-loading audio to test. Simply type your Nyquist generate code into the edit fields, then Left Click, TAB or SHIFT + TAB from one edit line to the next or previous line.

For example:

```
 (setq mysound (noise 10))
 (lp mysound (pwl 0 5000 10 100 10))
```

The first line generates 10 seconds of white noise and assigns it to the variable _"mysound"_.\
The second line applies a low-pass filter sweeping down from 5 kHz to 100 Hz over a period of 10 seconds to _"mysound"_.

A software tuning fork, with a table giving C notes and their equivalent MIDI note numbers near the top of the screen.

**Parameters:**

1. **Tone duration:** \[0 - 300 seconds, default = 120]
2. **Constant or fade out:** \[0=constant volume or 1=fade out, default = constant]
3. **MIDI or frequency:** \[0=MIDI 1=frequency, default = MIDI] - choose whether to generate tone with reference to a MIDI note number or a frequency. **Note:** Middle C = MIDI note 60, A above Middle C (440 Hz) = MIDI note 69.
4. **MIDI note:** \[16 - 127, default = 69] - You can use non-integer values here (such as 60.75)
5. **Frequency:** \[20 - 20000 Hz, default = 440]
