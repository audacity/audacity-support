# Scripting reference

This page lists scripting commands.

Yes these are the same commands as in the menus, same as in "Commands and Shortcuts" too, just presented differently.

* Presented in a format useful to people using:
  * Macros or
  * Python Scripting or
  * AUD-DO.
* Most of this page is automatically generated.

A few commands are intentionally omitted from the Macro Manager (such as "Close:") because they are unsuitable for use in Macros.

{% hint style="info" %}
This table shows the items in the menus that are scriptable.

* The Scripting Ids, parameters and defaults are all likely to change between versions.
* Boolean values must be given as 1 (true) or 0 (false).

### Extra: Scriptables I

These commands were originally written for scripting Audacity, e.g via a Python script that uses mod-script-pipe. The commands though are also present in the menu, available from macros, and available from within Nyquist using (AUD-DO "command")

Start and End are time. First and Last are track numbers. High and Low are for spectral selection. FromEnd allows selection from the end, which is handy to fade in and fade out a track. The Mode parameter allows complex selections, e.g adding or removing tracks from the current selection.                                                                                                                                                                  |

Setting one channel of a stereo track can lead to interesting results. That's most used when setting relative sizing of the two channels. SpectralPrefs=1 sets the track to use general preferences, SpectralPrefs=1 per track prefs. When using general preferences, SetPreferences can be used to change a preference and so affect display of the track. Name is used to set the name. It is not used in choosing the track. |
